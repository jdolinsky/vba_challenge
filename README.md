# Excel VBA Challenge
# **Stock Market Data Analysis** 
## Overview
This repository contains a VBA script file and screen shots of the final results.

For every stock, the script generates:

* Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
* The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
* The total stock volume of the stock

Additional summary is generated per Worksheet that shows the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
